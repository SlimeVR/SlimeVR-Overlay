## Contributing

### Installing the dependencies

First, install the `Rust` programming language by following the instructions at
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

Next, install `libclang`, which is used by the
[`ovr_overlay`](https://crates.io/crates/ovr_overlay) bindings for OpenVR. For windows,
use [this] link. For Linux, simply `sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev`.

You will also need SteamVR installed.


### Building

`cargo` is the build tool for rust. You can `cargo run` to run the code, `cargo check`
to check if your code compiles, and `cargo test` to run tests. You can also do
`--release` to generate an optimized release mode version. This will take longer to
compile but will run significantly faster.

### Documentation

Documentation is autogenerated by cargo and can be viewed in a web browser with
`cargo doc --all --open --no-deps --document-private-items`. You can read the CLI help
to learn more about what those flags do. The documentation is also automatically published to github pages for every commit on the `main` branch [here].
